# ocdsdata

## Installation

Requirements: python3, postgresql-10

Set up a venv and install requirements:
```
virtualenv -p python3 .ve
source .ve/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Example of creating an ocdsdata table and data:
```
sudo -u postgres createuser ocdsdata --pwprompt
sudo -u postgres createdb ocdsdata -O ocdsdata --encoding UTF8 --template template0 --lc-collate en_US.UTF-8 --lc-ctype en_US.UTF-8
export DB_URI='postgres://ocdsdata:PASSWORD YOU CHOSE@localhost/ocdsdata'
python ocdsdata-cli upgrade-database
```

## Running

Run `ocdsdata-cli run ` followed by the name of one or more of the publishers you want to fetch. You can also use the `--all` flag instead to run all.

## Configuration

Database settings can be set using a `~/.config/ocdsdata/config.ini` file. A sample one is included in the main directory.

It will also attempt to load the password from a '~/.pgpass' file, if one is present.

You can also set the `DB_URI` environmental variable to use a custom PostgreSQL server, for example `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname`.

The order of precedence is (from least-important to most-important):

  *  config file
  *  password from ~/.pgpass
  *  environmental variable

## Status of a run

During or after a run you can use a command to check on the progress.

Run `ocdsdata-cli status` with the source flag as the publisher you want to see. Pass the sample flag too, if it's a sample run.

By default it will show the progress for the latest run, but you can pass the dataversion flag to see different ones.

## Logging Configuration

This will provide additional logging information using the standard Python logging module, with loggers in the "ocdsdata" namespace.

When using the command line tool, it can be configured by setting a '~/.config/ocdsdata/logging.json' file. A sample one is included in the main directory.

## Run Tests

Run `py.test` from root directory.

## Main Database - Postgresql

Create DB Migrations with Alembic - http://alembic.zzzcomputing.com/en/latest/

    alembic --config=mainalembic.ini revision -m "message"

Add changes to new migration, and make sure you update database.py table structures and delete_tables to.

## Meta Database - SQLite

During Gather and Fetch stages, a local SQLite DB is used to track progress.

Create DB Migrations with Alembic - http://alembic.zzzcomputing.com/en/latest/

    alembic --config=metaalembic.ini revision -m "message"

Add changes to new migration, and make sure you update metadata_db.py table structures to.
