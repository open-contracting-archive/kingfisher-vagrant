# OCDS Kingfisher

Kingfisher is a family of tools to [collect](https://kingfisher-collect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [pre-process](https://kingfisher-process.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [summarize](https://kingfisher-views.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [query](https://kingfisher-colab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) OCDS data.

This repository collects issues that relate to multiple Kingfisher repositories. It also provides a Vagrant box, for developers to easily deploy the Kingfisher tools on personal computers.
